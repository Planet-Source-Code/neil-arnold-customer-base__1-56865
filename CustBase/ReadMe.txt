My training in programming consists in what I've taught myself from books, and from what I've learned from down-
loading code samples from sites like this. I'm sure that the way that I've done some of the things in this code
is maybe not the best way it could have been done, but it works. Any tips, or items of help from the people who
view this program would be greatly appreciated.

I got the idea for this program from one called Customer Manager by Intuit. A temporary job that I had was using
that program but there were a lot of things about it that they didn't like, so I've tried to address some of those
issues in this program.

Their complaints with Customer Manager were:
1] Data files could not be exported.
2] You could not query any user field data.
3] The system would sometimes add doubles and triples of their data entries
4] The screens were slow to load.

Plus there is a big difference in file size; Customer Manager weighs in at 31.3MB while Customer Base is only around 2MB.

There are still a couple of items not completed on this program:
1] The time-saver items on the Contact Comments screen, and on the Project Comments screen.
2] The "add file" commands on the Contact History pane, and on the Project History pane.
3] The Help files I've included are not what the final one is going to be like. This was just a kind of
   quick and dirty version to get going with.

I will be continuing to work on this project and will upload updates as they are completed.
